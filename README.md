# Economic-Freedom-of-The-World-Analysis

### This project analyzes the Economic Freedom of the World dataset to examine the relationship between economic freedom and different economic and social outcomes across countries. The primary goal is to explore how different levels of economic freedom—measured by factors like government size, legal system, sound money, and trade freedom—correlate with key indicators such as GDP per capita, unemployment rates, and Human Development Index (HDI).
